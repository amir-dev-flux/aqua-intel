AI-Driven Water Intelligence Platform for Arid Regions  
Focus Region: Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦

## Problem

Saudi Arabia faces extreme water scarcity and climate pressure on agriculture. Efficient irrigation and data-driven farming are critical to food security and Vision 2030 sustainability goals.

## Project Goal

Build an AI-powered platform that:

- Predicts irrigation water needs
- Analyzes climate patterns
- Uses ML/DL to optimize water usage
- Supports sustainable agriculture in arid regions

## Current Progress

- [x] Real NASA POWER climate data pipeline (Riyadh)
- [x] Data exploration and visualization
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] ML baseline model
- [ ] Deep learning forecasting (LSTM)
- [ ] Web deployment (Streamlit)
